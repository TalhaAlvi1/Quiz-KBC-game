The game welcomes you.

It asks one question at a time, displaying four options.

You type your answer (A/B/C/D).

If correct, you win money and move to the next question.

If wrong, the game ends, and you take home your last winning amount.

After the last question (or wrong answer), it shows the final prize amount.
